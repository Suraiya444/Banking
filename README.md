## ðŸ”’ Authentication Overview

**Laravel Sanctum** powers the APIâ€™s authentication system, allowing secure, token-based user access:

1. **Register or Log In**: Users can register or log in to receive a secure token.
2. **Token Usage**: Include the token in the `Authorization` header as `Bearer <token>` for authenticated API requests.

## ðŸ”§ API Endpoints

### User Management
- **Register**: `POST /api/register` â€“ Create a new user account.
- **Login**: `POST /api/login` â€“ Authenticate and retrieve an access token.
- **Logout**: `POST /api/logout` â€“ Revoke the current sessionâ€™s token.

### Account and Transaction Management
- **Accounts**: Full CRUD functionality to manage user accounts.
- **Transactions**: Process deposits, withdrawals, and transfers with structured endpoints.

For an in-depth look at all available endpoints and request/response structures, refer to the API documentation or use tools like **Postman** for testing.
